            Amelia I created this hoping you would see it
			<p>
			I don't know if you will ever read this, I don't even know why I am writting this. Maybe because there are only two things I love in life, tennis and writting. Not writting for English class, but something like this, my thoughts, recorded. It is a snapshot of me, every letter, text, email, update, is a snapshot of who I am. I keep these to later understand who I was, because whenever I am in the present, I don't know who I am. I don't now and I probably never will. I have a confession to make, I still think about you all the time Amelia, when I'm not doing anything I am thinking. I had devoloped the habit of thinking about what I would say to you. I can't break this habit, my thoughts are all still directed to you. If I am not talking or listening to someone, occupied with something external, or rapping in my mind, I am thinking about what I would say to you. About what I would write and explain to you if I could. I don't know if I will ever have the courage to ever tell you this, this is my cowardly way of telling you. Hoping that somehow you end up at this website. I'm still not over you Amelia and I don't think I will be for a long time. I may be a mess, but I am trying to learn to control it. I know that we are directly linked to our ancestors, there is nothing we can do about that. My dad's side of the family is a mess. About half my aunts and uncles are a mess of depression and social issues. There are a few that have learned to control it like my dad, my uncle Nick, and my aunt Shay. All the other 4 never figured it out. My sister Jaydin hasn't figured it out and her life is a complete mess. I don't want to end up like that, so I am trying and I will keep trying until I figure out how to control it. I wish I could undo what happened so we could go back to what we were, but I know that will never happen. I just ask you to forgive me, I still feel terrible for what I did. I won't ever forgive myself, so I hope you will. Please just talk to me, even if we have to go back to months ago before you were my best friend. If I have to lose another best friend to my stupidity, I still want you to be my friend. I'm sorry, I truly am, I can make as many excuses possible, but I won't change that I did it. I'm sorry, if you want any of the letters I ever wrote to you at one point, just tell me, I'll give them to you. It's painful seeing them, knowing they will never be read. Sorry for this being so long. -Matthew</p>
