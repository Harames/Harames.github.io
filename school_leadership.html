        <h3>Leadership activity #1: Sparkle and Shine</h3>
		<p>Choose a target market (a particular group of people you're trying to reach: i.e. athletes, parents, students, males, females), to deliver a presentation 		about the positive benefi ts of FBLA-Middle Level at your school.</p>
        <h3>Leadership activity #2: School interview</h3>
<p>With a partner, interview a school employee (teacher, faculty, administrator, support staff, volunteer, etc.) and write a three-paragraph article about them. Include their picture and be creative with your questions. Here are some samples to get you started: "What is your education background?", "What do you do in your job?", "What's the best part of your work?", "Where else have you worked?", "What are your goals?", "What's one piece of advice you have for students who want to be successful?"</p>
		<h3>Leadership activity #3: FBLA impact</h3>
		<p>Work in a team to create and deliver a presentation to school leaders about the positive benefi ts of FBLA-Middle Level (presentation may include PowerPoint, Prezi, video, report, brochure, etc.). Work with your adviser to upload the presentation.</p>
        <h3>Leadership activity #4: School volunteer</h3>
		<p>Volunteer to support another school project, performance, activity, or teacher for five hours. Remember to get approval from your adviser for the activity you have selected.</p>
        <h3>Leadership activity #5: We've Got Spirit - The School Leadership challenge</h3>
<p>Work in a team to complete a technology based activity that contributes to the positive spirit, climate, and environment of your school. Be creative! Here are some samples to get you started: design a series of inspirational school announcements, create a video highlighting a cool aspect of your school, create a catalog explaining opportunities at your school, create a brochure highlighting features of your school, provide audio-visual services for a school recognition event, or design logos for your school departments.</p>
