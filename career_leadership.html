		<h3>Leadership activity #1: character hired</h3>
		<p>In a team, choose a movie, video game, or TV show you all like (and that your parents approve!). Have each team member choose a character. Create a group presentation highlighting each character and at least three strengths and one weakness they each possess. As a group, pretend you are employers or starting a business. Identify which character you would want to hire to be on your team, and explain why at a chapter meeting.</p>
		<h3>Leadership activity #2: Game On</h3>
		<p>In a team, create a game designed for elementary students to have fun learning about the world of business, careers, and leadership. Be creative! Some examples include a board game, card game, slogan identification using clips from videos, scavenger hunt, word puzzles, etc. Give the game a name, design a logo, create instructions, and design the materials needed to play. Lead a group in playing the game at least one time.</p>
		<h3>Leadership activity #3: Tweet That</h3>
		<p>Select a book, magazine, blog, or video on leadership, careers, education, or an aspect of business. Create five 140 character messages (the length of a Tweet) that highlight or summarize key points you find valuable.</p>
		<h3>Leadership activity #4: career interview</h3>
		<p>Interview a person that works in business or industry (can be parents, family, FBLA professional members/alumni, etc.). Ask them about the top five skills, attitudes, and expectations they have of employees or coworkers. Provide a brief biography of who you interviewed and a summary of what you learned.</p>
		<h3>Leadership activity #5: Reverse career Day The career Leadership challenge</h3>
		<p>Pick a dream job and prepare a presentation that uses technology (i.e. PowerPoint, Prezi, Keynote, etc.) and outlines the job position, skills required to advance in this position, and the educational requirements needed to accomplish this dream job. Determine the cost of required education, and the estimated salary of someone in this position.</p>
